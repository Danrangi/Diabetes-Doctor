WMC Doctor â€“ Diabetes Prediction Web App

This project uses a Weighted Median Classifier (WMC) to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. It combines multiple ML models using their weighted accuracy to make more reliable predictions.

Features
- Accepts 8 standard medical inputs.
- Uses Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
- Applies a novel WMC ensemble method.
- Fast, explainable, and robust to noisy data.



 Dataset Used
- [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
